# WordleR: An R-based WORDLE Helper

WordleR is based on Knuth's list of 5757 most comment five-letter words:

Knuth's list was narrowed to 3000 words based on this analysis of English word frequency:

According to news reports, Wordle is actually based on a list of approx 2500 five-letter words agreed upon by the developer and his partner.

The list of 'guess' words WordleR displays is only a subset of matching words, in no particular order. _We suggest simply chosing the first word!_

WordleR is powered by R, the world's greatest data analytics language!
